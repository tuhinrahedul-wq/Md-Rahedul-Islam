Introduction:
Good morning everyone.
Today, I am going to present our project called ECOTRACK Solutions.
This project is based on smart recycling and waste management.
Our goal is to protect the environment using modern technology.

🔹 Problem Statement:
Nowadays, waste management is a big problem all over the world.
Every day, a huge amount of waste is produced.
Most recyclable waste like plastic, paper, and metal is not sorted properly.
As a result, these wastes end up in landfills and pollute the environment.
People also lack awareness about proper recycling.

🔹 Proposed Solution:
To solve this problem, we propose ECOTRACK Solutions.
It is a smart recycling station powered by Artificial Intelligence.
The system can automatically identify and sort waste.
Users do not need to think about which bin to use.
This makes recycling easier and more efficient.

🔹 Technology Used:
Our system uses modern technologies.
First, we use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
to learn and recognize different types of waste.

Second, we use Computer Vision
to analyze the shape, color, and size of the waste.

Third, we use Smart Sensors
to detect waste movement and bin capacity.

🔹 How the System Works:
Now I will explain how our system works step by step.

Step 1:
First, the user puts waste into the smart recycling machine.

Step 2:
Then, a camera captures the image of the waste.
AI analyzes the image and identifies the waste type.

Step 3:
After that, the system automatically sorts the waste
and sends it to the correct bin.

Step 4:
Finally, all data is stored and monitored
for reports and future analysis.

🔹 Social and Environmental Impact:
Our project has a strong positive impact on society and the environment.
It helps reduce landfill waste.
It increases recycling rates.
It also raises public awareness about recycling.
Overall, it helps create a cleaner and greener environment.

🔹 Future Scope:
In the future, this project can be expanded to more cities.
We can add a reward system to encourage people to recycle more.
Advanced data analytics can help improve waste management planning.
This system can also support smart city development.

🔹 Our Team:
This project is developed by a dedicated team.

Tuhin is the CEO, 
responsible for vision and management.
Shimanto is the CTO, 
responsible for technology and AI systems.
Imran is the Operation Manager, handling daily operations.
Sourov is the Lead Engineer, developing hardware and software.
Eren is the Site Engineer, responsible for installation and maintenance.

🔹 Conclusion:
In conclusion, ECOTRACK Solutions is a smart and sustainable solution
for modern waste management.
It combines technology with environmental responsibility.
This project can play an important role in building a cleaner future.
